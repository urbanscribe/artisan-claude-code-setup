# Confidence Booster Rule (Main Rule - Tier 2)
## Purpose
Automatically improves low-confidence outputs through systematic quality enhancement and remediation.

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### Quality Dimensions
**COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION**:
- **Clarity (20%)**: Objectives perfectly clear, no ambiguity
- **Evidence (25%)**: All claims backed by verifiable sources
- **Risk Analysis (25%)**: Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation
- **Reputation Stake (30%)**: Willingness to personally guarantee quality

### Scoring Rubric
**OBJECTIVE METRICS**:
- **90-100**: Exceptional quality, enterprise-ready
- **80-89**: High quality, minor improvements possible
- **70-79**: Good quality, systematic improvements needed
- **60-69**: Adequate quality, significant enhancements required
- **<60**: Poor quality, fundamental rework needed

## AUTOMATED REMEDIATION PROTOCOLS

### Clarity Enhancement (<80 clarity score)
**SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT**:
- **Ambiguity Elimination**: Replace vague terms with specific definitions
- **Context Addition**: Add missing background and prerequisites
- **Structure Refinement**: Organize content with clear hierarchies
- **Example Integration**: Add concrete examples for abstract concepts

### Evidence Strengthening (<80 evidence score)
**VERIFICATION ENHANCEMENT**:
- **Source Citation**: Add references to authoritative sources
- **Data Validation**: Include empirical evidence and benchmarks
- **Logic Verification**: Validate chains of reasoning and assumptions
- **Alternative Analysis**: Consider and refute alternative explanations

### Risk Analysis Completion (<80 risk score)
**COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT**:
- **Threat Identification**: Systematically identify all potential risks
- **Impact Assessment**: Quantify potential consequences and likelihood
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop specific risk reduction approaches
- **Contingency Planning**: Create backup plans for critical risks

### Reputation Stake Building (<80 stake score)
**QUALITY ASSURANCE**:
- **Independent Verification**: Cross-check claims against multiple sources
- **Peer Review Simulation**: Evaluate work against expert standards
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Test assumptions under extreme conditions
- **Long-term Viability**: Assess sustainability and maintenance requirements

## REMEDIATION EXECUTION CYCLE

### Phase 1: Gap Analysis
**SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION**:
1. **Score Calculation**: Apply rubric to identify specific weaknesses
2. **Priority Ranking**: Focus on highest-impact improvement areas first
3. **Effort Estimation**: Assess time and resources needed for remediation
4. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable improvement targets

### Phase 2: Targeted Improvements
**FOCUSED ENHANCEMENT**:
1. **Content Enhancement**: Add missing information and clarifications
2. **Structure Optimization**: Reorganize for better comprehension
3. **Evidence Integration**: Incorporate supporting data and references
4. **Quality Validation**: Cross-check improvements against requirements

### Phase 3: Validation and Iteration
**QUALITY VERIFICATION**:
1. **Re-assessment**: Reapply confidence rubric to measure improvements
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify remaining weaknesses and priorities
3. **Iteration Planning**: Plan next round of improvements if needed
4. **Completion Criteria**: Confirm all quality thresholds met

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (AUTOMATIC BLOCK)

### ❌ "Good Enough"
- **BLOCK**: Subjective quality acceptance without metrics
- **REASON**: Inconsistent standards, quality degradation over time
- **REMEDIATION**: Objective confidence scoring and systematic improvement

### ❌ "Stakeholder Approval"
- **BLOCK**: External validation without internal quality standards
- **REASON**: Stakeholder preferences may not align with quality requirements
- **REMEDIATION**: Independent quality assessment before stakeholder review

### ❌ "Time Pressure Exception"
- **BLOCK**: Quality compromises due to timeline constraints
- **REASON**: Technical debt accumulation, future maintenance burden
- **REMEDIATION**: Quality standards enforced regardless of schedule pressure

### ❌ "Expert Discretion"
- **BLOCK**: Subjective expert judgment without objective criteria
- **REASON**: Inconsistent application, difficult to scale or audit
- **REMEDIATION**: Standardized rubric application with clear scoring guidelines

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
